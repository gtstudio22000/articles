# Scrum Ceremonies Presentation

## Plan Your Sprints

At the start of each sprint, the whole Scrum Team gets together for a meeting called Sprint Planning. This meeting is for deciding what tasks will be completed in the sprint. The aim is to establish a list of deliverables for the end of the sprint.

- The Product Owner showcases the most pressing needs from the product backlog. 
- The team discusses each item and estimates the time required to complete it.
- They then prioritize their tasks and decide how many they can take on. 
- Finally, a sprint objective is set. 

Planning for a one-month sprint should not exceed 8 hours, but typically, sprints are shorter in duration.

## Daily Scrum

Every day, the Development Team meets for 15 minutes to discuss and prioritize tasks for the next day. This is called the Daily Scrum. 

- It helps track progress toward the Sprint Goal and revise the Sprint Backlog as needed.
- Each team member answers three questions:
    1. What did I do yesterday to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
    2. What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
    3. Are there any obstacles that prevent me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

The Daily Scrum is timeboxed to 15 minutes, regardless of the sprint's length.

## Sprint Review

At the end of each Sprint, a meeting called the Sprint Review is held to review the work done and update the Product Backlog if necessary.

- The Product Owner explains which backlog items are considered "Done" and which are not. 
- The Development Team discusses the sprint's successes and failures and the solutions they found. 
- The team demonstrates the work done and answers questions about the Increment. 
- Everyone collaborates to decide what to do next. 

The Sprint Review is timeboxed to 4 hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

## Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective gives the Scrum Team an opportunity to reflect and plan for improvement in the next Sprint. 

- Discuss the highs and lows of the sprint.
- Identify potential improvements for the next sprint. 
- Conclude with a positive forward-looking review. 

Remember, the success of the Scrum Team lies in its ability to communicate effectively, meet expectations, and progress towards goals.

## The Three Amigos Meeting

The Three Amigos meeting is a discussion around a user story from the perspectives of Business, Development, and Testing.

- There's no set duration, but generally, these meetings are quick and productive. 
- The Product Owner, a developer, and a tester discuss each user story to ensure common understanding before starting development.

## Focused Technical Meetings

Focused technical sessions are meetings where technical aspects of a project are discussed, planned, and decided upon. 

- The timing of these meetings depends on the topic of discussion.
- Possible topics include architecture planning, pair programming, code reviews, and paying down technical debt. 

While Scrum ceremonies provide a strong foundation, teams can and should adapt the framework to fit their specific needs.
